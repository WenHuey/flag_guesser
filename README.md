# Flag Guess

This is a flag guessing game, based on countries listed in [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html).

The intention was to make this with basic HTML/CSS/JS as a static page compatible with Github Pages, which hosts the page [here](http://jsalv.com/flag_guesser/). Each merged PR automatically uploads the latest code to this URL.
